ANS-1- LRU Cache :
			As a user you want pages to load as fast as possible. When a user opens a website, it
			opens the corresponding file on disk, read it in the HTML, and send it back over the 
			network. This is how it works but it is pretty slow, since accessing disk takes a while.
			
			So, if a lot of users request the same website, its better to only read it from the
			disk once while keeping the page in memory so you can quickly send it out again when 
			it is requested and that's simply all what a cache means and used for.

			A cache is just a fast storage which means reading data from a cache takes less time than  
			reading it from something else (like a hard disk) but caches are generally very small when
			compared to hard disks and far more costly as well. So, you can't fit everything in a cache
			and that's why you're still going to have to use larger and slower storage from time to time.

			>> We use two data structures to implement an LRU Cache. 
				- Queue : which is implemented using a doubly linked list. 
 
				- Hash : with page number as key and address of the corresponding queue node as value.

			>> Strengths:
				- Super fast accesses : LRU caches store items in order from most-recently used to least-recently used. 
							That means both can be accessed in O(1)O(1) time.

				- Super fast updates : Each time an item is accessed, updating the cache takes O(1)O(1) time.

			>> Weaknesses:
				- Space heavy:  An LRU cache storing n items requires a linked list of length n, and a hash map 
						storing n items. That's O(n)O(n) space which is two data structures and space heavy.



ANS-2- Steps:
		- Browser first splits the URL into a hostname and a path.

		- Then HTTP request is sent to ask for the data at the given hostname and path.

		- The HTTP request goes to the DNS Server to get the corresponding IP address 
		  attached to the given hostname and path.

		- A DNS server is a computer server that contains a mapped database of public IP addresses 
		  and their associated hostnames for all there is to find on the Internet. 

		- Then a TCP/IP connection is established to the computer specified via the IP address 
		  and then the browser sends the HTTP request to the given IP address of the Website.

		- TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a set of communication 
  		  protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. 

		- When the TCP/IP connection is established data from the web server can be freely 
		  shared under the TCP/IP protocols to the computer requesting the data.

		- When the Web server reads the hostname and path and finds or generates an HTTP 
		  response containing that data and sends that HTTP response to the browser.

		- Now the received HTTP response is split it into the headers and the body and the 
		  browser then interprets the data to decide how to display it in the browser.



ANS-3- NAT :
	        - NAT stands for Network Address Translation. Basically, NAT allows a single device 
		  like a router to act as a central source for an IP address to a public network and 
		  uses internal private IP addresses for the devices connected to the central router 
		  which means that only a single unique IP address is required to represent an entire 
		  group of devices to the rest of the network.

		  A router which is connected with the local network will be having an inside local 
		  IP addresses for the devices connected intenally or privately to it and the router 
		  itself which is connected to the global network will be having a global IP address.

       ARP :   
		- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a network protocol used to find out the hardware 
		  address i.e. MAC address of a device from an IP address. The sending device uses ARP 
		  to map IP addresses to MAC addresses. The device sends an ARP request containing the 
		  IP address of the receiving device.

		  ARP is one of the most important protocols of the network layer in the OSI model which 
		  helps in finding the MAC address (Media Access Control Address) from the IP address of 
		  the system i.e. the main duty of the ARP is to convert the 32-bit IP address(for IPv4) 
		  to 48-bit address i.e. the MAC address.



ANS-4- Deadlock Characteristics: 
				   A process in operating systems requests different resources and uses them
				   in the following way : 
					- Requests a resource 
					- Use the resource 
					- Releases the resource 

				   A deadlock happens in an operating system when two or more processes need 
				   some resources to complete their execution that is held by another process.

				   >> There are four conditions that must be present for a deadlock to occur:
					
					- Mutual Exclusion : There should be a resource that can only be held by 
							     one process at a time. So, the other processes which 
							     need the same resource can't have it.
							     
					- No Preemption : When a process can hold multiple resources and still request 
							  more resources from other processes which are holding them.

					- Hold and Wait : When a resource cannot be preempted from a process by force. 
							  A process can only release a resource voluntarily when it is 
							  ready or finished with its execution.
 
					- Circular Wait : When a process is waiting for the resource held by the second 
							  process, which is waiting for the resource held by the third 
							  process and so on, till the last process is waiting for a 
							  resource held by the first process making a circular chain 
							  of dependent processes.



ANS-5- Pagination : 		
			- Paging is a fixed size partitioning scheme for memory management.

			- In paging, secondary memory and main memory are divided into 
			  equal fixed size partitions.

			- The partitions of secondary memory are called pages.

			- The partitions of main memory are called frames.

			- Each process is divided into parts where the size of each part 
			  is the same as the page size.

			- The size of the last part may be less than the page size.

			- The pages of process are stored in the frames of main memory 
			  depending upon their availability.

			- Paging is a logical concept used for faster access to data.

			>> Advantages of Paging :
						 - Easy to use memory management algorithms.
						 - No need for external Fragmentation.
						 - Swapping is easy between equal-sized pages and page frames.

			>> Disadvantages of Paging :
						    - May cause Internal fragmentation
						    - Complex memory management algorithm
						    - Page tables consume additonal memory.
						    - Multi-level paging may lead to memory reference overhead.
