	from customer as c
	join address as a on c.address_id = a.address_id
	join city as cy on a.city_id = cy.city_id
	join country as ct on ct.country_id = cy.country_id
	where ct.country = 'Canada';

3. Display the most frequently rented movies in descending order.

    select f.title as 'Movie', count(r.rental_date) as 'Times Rented'
	from film as f
	join inventory as i on i.film_id = f.film_id
	join rental as r on r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
	group by f.title
	order by count(r.rental_date) desc;

4. Write a query to display how much business, in dollars, each store brought in.

	select concat(c.city,', ',cy.country) as `Store`, s.store_id as 'Store ID', sum(p.amount) as `Total Sales` 
	from payment as p
	join rental as r on r.rental_id = p.rental_id
	join inventory as i on i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
	join store as s on s.store_id = i.store_id
	join address as a on a.address_id = s.address_id
	join city as c on c.city_id = a.city_id
	join country as cy on cy.country_id = c.country_id
	group by s.store_id;

5. Write a query to display for each store its store ID, city, and country.

    select s.store_id as 'Store ID', c.city as 'City', cy.country as 'Country'
	from store as s
	join address as a on a.address_id = s.address_id
	join city as c on c.city_id = a.city_id
	join country as cy on cy.country_id = c.country_id
