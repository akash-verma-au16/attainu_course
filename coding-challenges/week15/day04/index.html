                        I was born on 3<sup>rd</sup> April, 1997 in Chandigarh, a beautiful city full of culture and lively people.
                        I graduated from BITS, Pilani with a Bachelors in Marine Engineering and went on to join Maersk Line as a 
                        Sailing Junior Engineer where I sailed on two of their Container Carriers. My life as a sailor took me around
                        the globe to many countries where I got the chance to take a peek into the lives and culture of people from 
                        different places. The time I spent exploring the world through my work gave me opportunities that I wouldn't
                        have gotten if I had chosen any other profession and for that I am grateful to have had a chance to do so many 
                        things that I wanted to do ever since I was little.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But my choices had led me to a place in life where I could feel my world narrowing for some reason, I started to 
                        see that the profession I had chosen was also limiting the choices that I could make and the things I could do 
                        with my life. The picture I was looking in my mind was not one which I ever wanted to come true, So, after a long 
                        introspection I decided to make a change in my life and joined AttainU to educate myself on another profession 
                        that I felt was more inline with the version of life that I had in mind. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        So, now I am here to reinvent myself to give myself a better chance at the life that I wanted to have. I love doing 
                        the work that we do here at AttainU and I hope that this will turn out to be the best decision that I made in my life.  
                    </p>
